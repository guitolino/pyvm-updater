## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-10

### Changed
* **textual is now a core dependency**: TUI works out of the box without extra install steps
* No longer requires `pip install pyvm-updater[tui]`, just `pip install pyvm-updater`

### Fixed
* Fixed TUI not working after fresh install (textual was optional, now required)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-10 - MAJOR TUI REDESIGN

### Added
- **Interactive TUI**: Complete redesign with navigable panels
  - Tab/Shift+Tab navigation between Installed, Available, and Status panels
  - Arrow key navigation within panels
  - Press Enter on Available panel to install selected version
  - Mouse click support for all interactions
- **mise Integration**: First-class support for mise version manager
  - Auto-detects mise-installed Python versions
  - Uses mise for installation on Linux/macOS when available

  - Fallback for unsupported environments

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Removed confusing modal input dialog
- **Installation Flow**: Now uses mise → pyenv → package manager chain
  - Linux: mise → pyenv → apt (deadsnakes) → dnf/yum

  - Windows: Official python.org installer (unchanged)
- **TUI Layout**: Three-panel design (Installed | Available | Status)

- Cross-platform consistency across Linux, macOS, and Windows

### Technical
- Refactored TUI to use ListView widgets for better keyboard support
- Added comprehensive error handling for suspend operations
- Improved version detection to scan multiple installation directories
- Better cross-platform path handling

## [1.2.1] - 2025-11-30 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY FIX

### 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES
- **REMOVED**: `pyvm set-default` command (was causing system crashes)
- **REMOVED**: `--set-default` flag from `pyvm update` command
- **CHANGED**: Tool now ONLY installs Python side-by-side, never modifies system defaults

### Fixed (Critical)
- **System freeze issue**: Removed all code that modified `/usr/bin/python3` symlink via `update-alternatives`
- **Terminal crashes**: Eliminated dangerous system Python default modification that broke package managers
- **System GUI failures**: Removed code that could prevent system settings from opening
- **Package manager corruption**: No longer touches system Python configuration

### Removed
- `_set_python_default_linux()` function (~150 lines of dangerous code)
- `prompt_set_as_default()` function
- `_show_access_instructions()` function (replaced with safe version)
- `pyvm set-default` CLI command
- `--set-default` flag from update command

### Added
- `show_python_usage_instructions()` - Safe, read-only instruction display
- Comprehensive safety documentation (`CRITICAL_SECURITY_FIX_v1.2.1.md`)
- Clear warnings in README about safe behavior
- Instructions for using Python via virtual environments (recommended approach)

### Changed
- `update_python_linux()` now only installs Python, never modifies system defaults
- All docstrings updated to clarify safe, non-invasive behavior
- CLI help text updated to emphasize safety
- Tool version bumped to 1.2.1

### Documentation
- Added `CRITICAL_SECURITY_FIX_v1.2.1.md` with recovery instructions
- Updated README with prominent safety warning
- Added `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for quick command comparison
- Updated all examples to show safe usage patterns

**Migration Guide**: If you were using `pyvm set-default`, switch to virtual environments:
```bash
python3.12 -m venv myproject
source myproject/bin/activate
```

**For Affected Users**: See `CRITICAL_SECURITY_FIX_v1.2.1.md` for system recovery instructions.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-11-09 ⚠️ DEPRECATED - Contains System-Breaking Code

### Added
- **`--set-default` flag**: New option for `pyvm update --set-default` to automatically set the newly installed Python as system default (Linux only)
- **`pyvm set-default` command**: Standalone command to manage Python versions
  - `pyvm set-default` - Lists all available Python versions on the system
  - `pyvm set-default 3.12` - Sets a specific version as system default
- **Automatic version detection**: Automatically finds and registers existing Python installations
- **Installation verification**: Verifies Python installation after update and shows the path
- **Additional packages**: Now installs `python3.x-venv` and `python3.x-distutils` for complete setup on Ubuntu/Debian

### Changed
- **Improved `update-alternatives` setup**: Now automatically configures both old and new Python versions with proper priorities
- **Better default setting**: Uses `update-alternatives --set` for immediate effect without user interaction
- **Enhanced verification**: After setting default, automatically verifies with `python3 --version`
- **More robust path detection**: Checks both `/usr/bin` and `/usr/local/bin` for Python installations
- **Improved error messages**: Clearer feedback when Python version not found or commands fail

### Fixed
- **Linux default Python issue**: Fixed the core issue where installed Python wasn't being set as system default
- **Hardcoded version bug**: Removed hardcoded Python 3.12 reference in `_set_python_default_linux()`
